Problem 1:
How do we track learners at CLC events (workshops and classes), capture their demographic data, and measure the impact of these events? CLC would like to track age, gender, location, visible minority status, and previous CLC engagements. CLC would also like to track if these events have inspired learners to pursue a CS program or career.

Solving problem statement 1 by developing a platform aimed at young professionals, that allows students of CLC to stay connected and build a community of support and create a report on learner reach and effectiveness of inspiring.
